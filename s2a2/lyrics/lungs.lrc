[ti: Dog Days Are Over]
[length: 04:13]

[00:15.58]Happiness hit her like a train on a track
[00:25.35]Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
[00:37.21]
[00:39.71]She hid around corners and she hid under beds
[00:45.83]She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
[00:52.41]With every bubble, she sank with her drink
[00:58.87]And washed it away down the kitchen sink
[01:05.40]The dog days are over
[01:08.59]The dog days are done
[01:11.80]The horses are coming
[01:14.52]So you better run
[01:17.83]Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[01:21.49]Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[01:24.65]Leave all your love and your longing behind
[01:27.44]You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
[01:30.20]The dog days are over
[01:33.99]The dog days are done
[01:37.32]Can you hear the horses?
[01:40.38]'Cause here they come
[01:44.82]
[01:50.05]And I never wanted anything from you
[02:02.22]Except everything you had
[02:08.92]And what was left after that too, oh
[02:16.22]Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
[02:26.24]
[02:28.50]Struck from a great height
[02:32.47]By someone who should know better than that
[02:41.35]The dog days are over
[02:44.84]The dog days are done
[02:47.71]Can you hear the horses?
[02:49.45]'Cause here they come
[02:53.85]
[03:06.70]Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
[03:10.18]Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
[03:13.26]Leave all your love and your longing behind
[03:16.98]You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
[03:19.14]The dog days are over
[03:22.88]The dog days are done
[03:26.12]Can you hear the horses?
[03:30.15]'Cause here they come
[03:33.06]The dog days are over
[03:35.61]The dog days are done (here they come)
[03:39.05]The horses are coming
[03:41.85]So you better run (here they come)
[03:45.43]The dog days are over
[03:48.38]The dog days are done (here they come)
[03:51.64]The horses are coming
[03:54.89]So you better run
[03:58.28]
