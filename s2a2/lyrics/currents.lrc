[00:27.62]It's always around me, all this noise, but
[00:33.34]Not nearly as loud as the voice saying
[00:39.05]"Let it happen, let it happen"
[00:44.63]"Just let it happen, let it happen"
[00:49.19]
[00:56.89]All this running around
[01:00.65]Trying to cover my shadow
[01:04.48]An ocean growing inside
[01:08.23]Now all the others seem shallow
[01:12.24]All this running around
[01:16.12]Bearing down on my shoulders
[01:19.94]I can hear an alarm
[01:23.78]Must be morning
[01:26.34]
[01:44.04]I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
[01:49.95]It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound and
[01:55.90]When it happens, when it happens
[02:01.41]So let it happen, let it happen
[02:05.75]
[02:09.84]All this running around
[02:13.70]I can't fight it much longer
[02:17.41]Something's trying to get out
[02:21.39]And it's never been closer
[02:25.17]If my take-off fails
[02:29.01]Make up some other story
[02:32.68]But if I never come back
[02:36.66]Tell my mother I'm sorry
[02:39.76]
[07:00.51]Baby, now I'm ready, moving on
[07:05.73]Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
[07:11.55]Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
[07:17.30]Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
[07:22.92]
[07:23.06]Oh, baby, now I'm ready, moving on
[07:28.83]Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
[07:34.59]Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound
[07:40.40]Oh, but maybe I was ready all along
[07:46.00]
